There are two main Add-ons in the repository:

 - [Lstyle](https://github.com/Eltaurus-Lt/Lt-Anki-Addons/tree/main/Lstyle) - Modifies the main deck window, allowing adding thumbnails for the decks and manually adjusting their order
 - [Ps](https://github.com/Eltaurus-Lt/Lt-Anki-Addons/tree/main/Ps) - Allows opening images from a card in an image editor (Photoshop by default) with a single click

There are also templates, which can be used as a base for building other Anki add-ons:

 - [Anki Deck Styling Addon Template](https://github.com/Eltaurus-Lt/Lt-Anki-Addons/tree/main/Anki-Deck-Styling-Addon-Template) - Injects custom css and js into Anki windows to modify styling and functionality
 - [Editor Button](TODO) - Adds a button to the Anki editor toolbar
