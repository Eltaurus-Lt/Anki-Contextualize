There is only one addon so far:

 - [Lstyle](https://github.com/Eltaurus-Lt/Lt-Anki-Addons/tree/main/Lstyle)

There is also a template, which can be used to build other Anki addons dealing with the styling of the main page and the decks' pages:

 - [Anki Styling Addon Template](https://github.com/Eltaurus-Lt/Lt-Anki-Addons/tree/main/Anki%20Styling%20Addon%20Template)
