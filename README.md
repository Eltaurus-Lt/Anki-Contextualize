There is only one addon so far:

 - [Lstyle](https://github.com/Eltaurus-Lt/Lt-Anki-Addons/tree/main/Lstyle)

There is also a template, which can be used as a base for building other Anki addons that add elements to the main page and deck pages or change their styling:

 - [Anki Deck Styling Addon Template](https://github.com/Eltaurus-Lt/Lt-Anki-Addons/tree/main/Anki-Deck-Styling-Addon-Template)
