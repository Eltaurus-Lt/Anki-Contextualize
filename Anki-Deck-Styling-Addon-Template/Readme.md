This is a base for building Anki addons that modify appearance of the main window (deck list, top menu, and the bar with buttons at the bottom) or the deck windows.
The kit contains bare bones of a deck styling addon: a JavaScript file to modify html source-code of anki pages 
(the stock example uses a jQuery line to dye the backbround light-blue), and an _init_ python script to embed the JavaScript text into Anki.
